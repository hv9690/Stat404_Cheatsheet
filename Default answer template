This is a TEST problem with a one/two-sided alternative:

H0 : μA = μB , H1 : μA ̸= μB .

The x-statistic value (assuming equal variance) is found to be x.

The reference distribution is T/F with x degrees of freedom. 

Accordingly, the p-value of this test is x.

At the y% level, we not/reject the equal mean null hypothesis.
